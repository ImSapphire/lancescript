# lancescript
I'm happy to return after changing my mind, and I'm continuing development on this script again. Some things have changed, which everyone will easily adapt to. 
There may have been a lot of scripts made since I shut everything down, but time has proved that nothing will ever be like LanceScript. 

**LanceScript**
It's hard to summarize this script because LanceScript is a swiss-army knife for everything Stand and GTA V. There are options for folks of all levels of toxicity, and even if you don't troll, you will find a lot of use and fun out of LanceScript.

A few things:
- Written in 7000+ lines of code
- Has one of the best (silent) aimbots in any Lua or menu
- Has simple and easy language file support
- Has several options for your ped, your vehicle, the world, the game, entities, traffic, peds, and much more.
- Has graphics modification options
- Has several utility/trolling/fun options for online play
- Has utilities that make Stand and GTA V easier to use as well as protections and detections
- Has much more options, more than I will ever be able to list.

LanceScript is reputable and has had more than thousands of happy users before. So what are you waiting for? It only takes a few seconds to install and reap the benefits.

## Installation
Drag all the files into your Lua Scripts directory. That's it. 

## Bugs and feedback
Please post any bug reports or feedback in our Discord, which can be accessed through the script.
